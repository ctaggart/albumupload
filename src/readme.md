# Album Download

Album Download is a web browser extension that is available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/album-download/mnaphpmipihkgnfkkhdadabcfeijmhpb). Buy a 6-month subscription for $3. I built it because I store all my photos in Google Photos and I wanted an easier ways to share them.

*New*: Subscriptions may be purchased below. After signing in to your Google account, a link will presented to pay for a subscription or to manage your existing subscription. The subscription will be associated with the Google Account you logged in with.
